# General Linux #

1. How do you determine how much CPU is being utilized at the system level?

        Most basic way would be to use the 'top' command.

1. How do you determine how much CPU is being utilized by a specific process?

        If you know the PID of the process in question: ps -p <PID> -o %cpu
        To find the PID of a process by name I usually us: ps ax | grep <name>

1. How would your answers to question 1 and 2 change if we were interested in looking at memory consumption?

        system level I use 'free'
        process level I use: ps -p <PID> -o %mem

1. How would your answers to question 1 and 2 change if we were interested in looking at disk or block input/output?

        system level: df has been as useful of a command that I've required in my experience
        process level: Honestly not sure on this one without looking it up.

1. How would your answers to question 1 and 2 change if we were interested in looking at network utilization?

        system level: I normally use ifstat.
        process level: I'm not really sure how you could do that with system utils.  There are opensource utils that you could
        use to do such a thing.  nethog is one.

1. What is the difference between a process' virtual set size and resident set size? How does this affect the system as a whole?

        RSS is memory in the RAM of the system.  VSS is the portion of memory that lives on the disk and is managed by the kernel


1. What does strace do? How would you use it to debug a misbehaving process?

        I've used strace in the past as a sort of debugger. It's a basic way of seeing sys calls and what they return. I can think
        of only a few instances of needing to use this.  I guess if you don't have source code it can be informative.

1. Name a utility you have used to do kernel level tracing.

        Honestly I've never ran into and instance where I needed to do this.

1. How would you read a log file located in `/var/log/messages`?

        Not sure I quite understand the question.  One could tail the log or cat the log to read it.  If you're looking for
        the case that someone is looking at this log and wondering how to read it they'll be looking at a general log of the system.


1. If I told you to use the command `jabberwocky`, how can you find its
   documentation *without using Google?*

        I would try 'man jabberwocky'.  Sometimes 'jabberwocky --help' can point you in the right direction too.

1. How do you redirect `stderr` and `stdout` to the same file?

        You can say 'command &> somefile'

1. How do you background a currently running long executing process?  How do you bring the process
   back to the foreground?

        This is the first question I've been completely clueless on.  In answering it I would just be gathering all my knowlege
        from google to do so.  I don't want to give the impression that I'm a master level linux user.

1. Given a log file located at `/var/log/mydaemon.log` which contains an
   indefinite number of lines like:

        Fri Jun 12 2014 12:00:01.345 user 'alice' logged in
        Fri Jun 12 2014 14:11:01.112 user 'bob' logged in
        Sun Jun 14 2014 00:11:01.112 ERROR: disk full
        Sun Jun 14 2014 01:05:10.100 ERROR: host is down
        Sun Jun 14 2014 08:33:33.333 successful backup

    How would you print the twenty most recently logged lines that contain error
 messages?

        I think you need a combination of grep and tail.  I haven't tried this out but maybe grep <error> <file> | tail -n 20

1. What is the purpose/use of `procfs`?  Where do you look to find `procfs`?

        I don't have a great understanding of this but procfs is a sort of file system for the kernel.  I believe it's mounted
        somewhere, maybe /proc.

1. What are the steps for configuring and executing a passwordless login
   session to a remote Linux system?

        Generally speaking here are the steps:
        -Generate an ssh key on your system using ssh-keygen tool
        -Copy the ssh key to the .ssh dir on the remote system under the user you want to ssh in as.


# Networking #

1. What are important differences between TCP and UDP protocols?

        TCP has verification in place to ensure all packets are received.
        UDP does the same as TCP just doesn't do verification. UDP is used for speed.

1. Please provide basic troubleshooting steps for isolating connectivity
   problem between two Linux hosts, using only the shell.

        ifconfig to make sure your connected and have ip, dns, all that fun stuff
        Then try to ping the remote host.  This will tell you if it is responding.
        Then check firewall. It could be blocking your port i.e 22 for ssh
        Check ssh_config
        Check to make sure your ssh service is installed and running
        Restart ssh service with systemctl or service
        Restart network
        If you have access to the remote system you can use netstat and grep for listening ports


1. How do you list a system's currently open ports and/or active connections?

        netstat


# Development #

1. Why is it important to use software version control?

        Version control is important for a lot of reasons.  It provides sort of a living history of your codebase
        tracks all changes, shows who made the change, why the change was made, and when it was made.  Gives you the
        ability to roll back changes and for multiple people to work on the same code base at the same time.  I don't
        know how you could get by without it.

1. For a directory containing multiple files, implement a way to scan each file
   for the string "foobar" and replace it with "fubar"

        This is implemented in foobar.py
        Edit line 53 for the directory you want your foo files.  (I should have made these variables ones you pass in)
        Run foobar.py

1. How can you create 100 files named `000.pp` ... `099.pp` whose contents are (1 class per file):

        class myfile000 {
          if $kernel == "Linux" {
            file { '/tmp/myfile000':
              ensure  => file,
              backup  => false,
              content => "Hello myfile000",
            }
          }
        }

        ...

        class myfile099 {
          if $kernel == "Linux" {
            file { '/tmp/myfile099':
              ensure  => file,
              backup  => false,
              content => "Hello myfile099",
            }
          }
        }


        This is implemented in create_files.py
        Just run create_files.py

    Create a program that will extract the data from the CSV file and perform the
 following operations:

    * Organize and sort the data by customer name.
            Implemented in sort_csv_by_name.py

    * Calculate the total number of orders per customer.
            Implemented in print_order_number.py
    * Calculate the average cost of orders per customer.

 Once the CSV has been loaded into a data model, create a report file containing
 the desired information from above in either JSON or XML format. You may use built-in
 JSON or XML libraries, and other built-in functions like sorting & searching in the language
 of your choice. (This includes using psuedocode.) You should provide your code as text in the same file as your previous answers.
